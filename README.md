canvasResize
=============

**canvasResize** is a plug-in for client side image resizing. It's compatible with **iOS6**. 

It can work both with **jQuery** and **Zepto**

I fixed iOS6 Safari's image file rendering issue for large size image (over mega-pixel) using few functions from 
[**ios-imagefile-megapixel**](https://github.com/stomita/ios-imagefile-megapixel)
And fixed *orientation* issue by using 
[**exif-js**](https://github.com/jseidelin/exif-js)
 
You can change image size and quality with plugin [**options**](#options) easily.

### Tested on: 
 *  Chromium (24.0.1312.56)
 *  Google Chrome (25.0.1364.68 beta)
 *  Opera (12.14)
 *  IOS 6.1.2

    $('input[name=photo]').change(function(e) {
        var file = e.target.files[0];
        canvasResize(file, {

            height: 0,
            crop: false,
            quality: 80,
            //rotate: 90,
            callback: function(data, width, height) {
                $(img).attr('src', data);
            }
        });
    });

**Dependencies**

    NodeJS
    npm
    bower

If you plan on developing canvasResize, you can clone the repo or download the zip from the links at right. 
Once the project is on your machine go to a command prompt in the project root and type:

    npm update
    bower update
    grunt

That will load the dependencies and make an initial build of the source.

You can also type:

    grunt watch
    
which will leave the command running. What that does is monitor the source files for changes and run a new build
when the source changes.
